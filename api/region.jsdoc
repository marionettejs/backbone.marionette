name: Region

class: Marionette.Region

extends:
  - Backbone.Events
  - Backbone.extend

description: |
  Regions provide consistent methods to manage, show and destroy views in your applications and layouts. 
  They use a jQuery selector to show your views in the correct place.

examples:
  -
    name: Adding a region to your app
    example: |
      You can add regions to your applications by calling the `addRegions` method on
      your application instance. This method expects a single hash parameter, with
      named regions and either jQuery selectors or `Region` objects. You may
      call this method as many times as you like, and it will continue adding regions
      to the app.
      
      ```js
      MyApp.addRegions({
        mainRegion: "#main-content",
        navigationRegion: "#navigation"
      });
      ```
     
      As soon as you call `addRegions`, your regions are available on your
      app object. In the above, example `MyApp.mainRegion` and `MyApp.navigationRegion`
      would be available for use immediately.
      
      If you specify the same region name twice, the last one in wins.
      
  -
    name: Adding a region to a layout
    example: |
      You can add regions to your layouts by setting a regions property on the class. When 
      the layout is shown, it should show its subviews in its regions.
      
      ```js
      var AppLayoutView = Backbone.Marionette.LayoutView.extend({
        template: "#layout-view-template",
        
        regions: {
          menu: "#menu",
          content: "#content"
        },
        
        onShow: function() {
          this.menu.show(new MenuView());
          this.content.show(new MainContentView());
        }
      });
      ```

  - 
    name: Creating a standalone region
    example: |
      You can create a standalone region, by simply instantiating a region and providing a
      way to find an el on the page. 
      
      Once a region is instantiated, it can be used to show a view inside it. 
      
      ```js
      var myRegion = new Region({
        el: '.my-region'
      });
      
      myRegion.show(new Backbone.View());
      ```

constructor: |
  The Region constructor function is responsible for setting up the region and its root element.
  
  There are four ways to specify an `el` when instantiating a region
  1. as a selector as a class property
  2. as a selector as a constructor option
  3. as a dom element as a constructor option
  4. as a jQuery element as a constructor option
  
  #### 1. `el` as a class property
  
  ```js
  var SomeRegion = Backbone.Marionette.Region.extend({
    el: "#some-div",
  });
  
  MyApp.someRegion = new SomeRegion();
  MyApp.someRegion.show(someView);
  ```
  
  #### 2. `el` as a selector:
  
  ```js
  var mgr = new Backbone.Marionette.Region({
    el: "#someElement"
  });
  ```
  
  #### `el` as raw DOM node reference:
  
  ```js
  var mgr = new Backbone.Marionette.Region({
    el: document.querySelector("body")
  });
  ```
  
  #### `el` as a `jQuery` wrapped DOM node:
  
  ```js
  var mgr = new Backbone.Marionette.Region({
    el: $("body")
  });

  @param {Object} options

properties:
  el: |
    The `el` property is the root dom element that holds the view's element.
    
    Note that a region must have an element to attach itself to when it is instantiated. 
    If you do not specify a selector when attaching the region instance to your
    Application or LayoutView, the region must provide an `el` either in its
    definition or constructor options.
  
  $el: |
    The `$el` property is the jQuery wrapped version of `el`.
  
  currentView: |
    The `currentView` property references the currently shown view. 
    If `currentView` is `undefined`, the region is empty.

  triggerBeforeAttach: |
    Whether or not the Region will trigger the `before:attach` event on nested views that are about
    to be attached. Defaults to `true`.

    In general, the only time you'll want to set this to false is if you're rendering hundreds or
    thousands of views and are running into performance problems.

  triggerAttach: |
    Whether or not the Region will trigger the `attach` event on nested views that have been attached.
    Defaults to `true`.

    As with triggerBeforeAttach, you might want to set this to `false` if you're rendering many, many
    views and are running into performance problems.

  initialize: |
    If `initialize` is set in the Region class, it will be called when new regions are instantiated.
    
    The `initialize` function is a good place to put custom, post instantiation class logic. 
    
    ```js
    var SomeRegion = Backbone.Marionette.Region.extend({
      initialize: function() {
        // do some stuff
      }
    });
    
    MyApp.someRegion = new SomeRegion();
    ```
    
    @param {Object} options - The constructor's options

functions:
  buildRegion: |
    Returns a new Region from the `regionConfig` object. This is used by the RegionManager to
    create a new Region instance. Any options supplied in the `regionConfig` other than
    `selector` and `regionClass` are provided as the instance's `options`.

    @api public
    @static
    @param {Object} regionConfig
    @param {Marionette.Region} DefaultRegionClass

  _buildRegionFromSelector: |
    Build the region from a string selector like '#foo-region'
    
    @api private
    @static  
    @param {String} selector  
    @param {Marionette.Region} DefaultRegionClass  

  _buildRegionFromObject: |
    Build the region from a configuration object
    ```js
    { selector: '#foo', regionClass: FooRegion }
    ```
    
    @api private
    @static
    @param {Object} regionConfig
    @param {Marionette.Region} DefaultRegionClass

  _buildRegionFromRegionClass: |
    Build the region directly from a given `RegionClass`
    
    @api private
    @static
    @param {Marionette.Region} RegionClass

  show: |
    Shows `newView` inside the region if `newView` is not already shown within the region. The previous view, if one exists,
    will be destroyed in this process. The `show` methods fires the show and swap triggerMethods.
    
    By default, a region must have a containing element in the DOM, and if this element is not available, an error
    is thrown. In some instances it may be desirable to allow a view to define a region which its template does not
    provide, such as regions defined by a parent `LayoutView` class that are used by only some of its subclasses.
    In these instances, the region should be defined with the `allowMissingEl` option, suppressing the missing
    element error and causing `show` calls to be treated as no-ops.

    You can modify the behavior of `show` by passing in an `options` object. The following options are supported:
    
    `preventDestroy`
    Pass this as `true` to prevent the destruction of the old view. This is not recommended, as Views
    are intended to be throwaway objects in Marionette. You are encouraged to only use this option
    if the View you are rendering is a render-heavy view, such as a large chart or graphic.
    
    ```js
    // Show the first view.
    var myView = new MyView();
    MyApp.mainRegion.show(myView);
    
    // Replace the view with another. The `destroy` method is called for you
    var anotherView = new AnotherView();
    MyApp.mainRegion.show(anotherView);
    
    // Replace the view with another. Prevent `destroy` from being called
    var anotherView2 = new AnotherView();
    MyApp.mainRegion.show(anotherView2, { preventDestroy: true });
    
    `forceShow`
    By default passing the same view to `show` will be a noop; your view will not be rendered, and no
    events will be fired. Pass `true` for this option to cause the entire show process to happen again,
    including events and the re-rendering of your view.
    
    ```js
    var myView = new MyView();
    MyApp.mainRegion.show(myView);
    
    // the second show call will re-show the view
    MyApp.mainRegion.show(myView, {forceShow: true});
    ```

    `triggerAttach`
    Whether or not to trigger the `attach` event on the views being shown. This overrides the property
    on the prototype.

    `triggerBeforeAttach`
    Whether or not to trigger the `before:attach` event on the views being shown. This overrides the property
    on the prototype.
    
    @api public
    @param {Marionette.View} view
    @param {Object} options

  _ensureElement: |
    Ensure that `this.el` and `this.$el` is set. If 
    
    @api private

  getEl: |
    Returns the jQuery Object of `el`.
    Do note that it is not recommended that you override this method because it is ignored in certain circumstances.
    
    @api private
    @param {} el

  attachHtml: |
    This method determines how the view's html is attached to the Region's element. The default
    method is using append. You can override this if you would like to, for instance, specify that
    the view's element fade in to view.
    
    You can override `attachHtml` for transition effects and more. 
    This example will cause a view to slide down from the top of the region, instead of just appearing in place.
    
    ```js
    Marionette.Region.prototype.attachHtml = function(view){
      this.$el.hide();
      this.$el.html(view.el);
      this.$el.slideDown("fast");
    }
    ```
    
    @api private
    @param {Marionette.View} view

  empty: |
    Empty calls `destroy` on the `currentView`. This has the consequence of clearing the contents
    of the Region.
    
    @api public
  
  _destroyView: |
    Call 'destroy' or 'remove', depending on which is found on the view (if showing a raw Backbone view or a Marionette View).
  
    @api private
  
  attachView: |
    Associate a new view with the region by setting the region's value of `currentView`. This will not call render,
    show, or fire any events.
    
    @api private
    @param {Marionette.View} view
  
  hasView: |
    Checks whether a view is currently present within the region. 
    
    @api public

  reset: |
    Reset the region by calling `empty`, which destroys its view and clears its content. It then deletes
    the cached `$el` property. Finally it sets `this.el` to the value of the selector string of the old
    element.
    
    This prepares the Region to be 're-initialized' with a new element based on the old selector
    string, and is used by the LayoutView when it re-renders itself.
