### v1.8.6 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.8.5...v1.8.6)

  * Regions
    * `Region.show` now returns the region instance to allow for region operation chaining.
    * `Region.show` triggers the view's native `triggerMethod` if it exists. This is to handle the case that triggerMethod is wrapped by a `Marionette.Behavior`.

  * General
    * Update jquery 2.x upper bound dependency restrictions.
    * The grunt test command will now complain if you do not have bower components installed.
    * Readme cleanups.

### v1.8.5 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.8.4...v1.8.5)

  * Fixes
    * Update the UMD build to be inline with the 2.x branch UMD implementation.

### v1.8.4 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.8.3...v1.8.4)

  * General
    * Update bundled build to use the latest version of babysitter and wreqr.

### v1.8.3 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.8.2...v1.8.3)

  * Fixes
    * Behaviors now have access to the views options and events during their initialize.

### v1.8.2 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.8.0...v1.8.2)

  * Fixes
    * Behaviors now calls `stopListening` on close.
    * Behaviors now undelegate `modelEvents` and `collectionEvents` when the parent view calls `undelegateEvents`.

### v1.8.0 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.7.4...v1.8.0)

  * General
    * Update Gruntfile.
    * The default task (`grunt`) now runs tests.
    * `$ grunt dev` watch for watching.
    * `$ grunt build` runs the tests and compiles.
    * Add better inline documentation for module implementation.
    * Add better inline behavior documentation.

  * Fixes
    * Behaviors now correctly lookup methods for `modelEvents` and `collectionEvents`.
    * The `CollectionView` now triggers close on its children in the correct order.

  * Features
    * Add `onRoute` to the `appRouter`.
    ```js
      Backbone.Marionette.AppRouter.extend({
        onRoute: function(route, params) {
        }
      })
    ```
    * `Region.show` now takes an option to prevent closing the previous view in the region. By default a region will automatically close the previous view, however you can prevent this behavior by passing `{preventDestroy: true}` in the options parameter.
    ```js
    myRegion.show(view2, { preventDestroy: true })
    ```
    * Add  a `getRegion`  method to `Layout`. This is in line with the eventual goal of not attaching regions to the root layout object.
    * Behavior instances now extend from Backbone.Events, allowing you to use `.listenTo` and `.on`.

    * Allow Behaviors to have a functional hash lookup.
    ```js
      Marionette.ItemView.extend({
        behaviors: function() {
          // “this” will refer to the view instance
          return : {
            BehaviorA: {}
          }
        }
      })
    ```
    * RegionManagers now calls `stopListening` on a regions on removal.

  * Refactors
    * Abstract underscore collection method mixin into a generic helper.
    * Use built in marionette extend for behaviors.

  * Tests
    * Add a whitespace linter to the text coverage. Trailing whitespace now causes travis.ci to fail.
    * Add test coverage for `bindEntitiyEvents` and `unbindEntityEvents`.
    * Test public API for the `regionManager`.
    * Improve view trigger tests for better control when testing.

### v1.7.4 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.7.3...v1.7.4)

* General
  * Update bower dependencies to take advantage of the fact that marionette repos follow semver.

* Fixes
  * Behaviors events no longer collide with each other.
  * Revert `stopListening` call on `stop` for modules. While this was a "fix", the docs were quite vague leading to breaking changes for many people.
  * `startWithParent` is now respected when using a `moduleClass` property.

### v1.7.0 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.6.4...v1.7)

Version 1.7 represents a significant step in formalizing the ways to improve your `view` code though reusable `behaviors`. Say goodbye to custom mixin strategies and welcome `behaviors` into town.

* Behaviors

    A `Behavior` is an  isolated set of DOM / user interactions  that can be mixed into any `View`. `Behaviors` allow you to blackbox `View` specific interactions into portable logical chunks, keeping your `views` simple and your code DRY. **[Read the docs here.](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.behavior.md)**

* Modules
    * Call stop listening on module stop.

* Events
    * add a before:show event for views and regions

* Docs
    * Entire refactor of application docs.

* Tests
    * Rework the module tests to improve readability and consistency.

* General
    * switch from `~` to `^` for *trusted* dependencies.

### v1.6.4 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.6.3...v1.6.4)

  * Improvements
    * Enable more direct module instantiation on `Marionette.App`.
      ```js
        var ItemModule = Marionette.Module.extend({
          startWithParent: false,
          initialize: function(options) {},
          onStart: function() {}
        });

        // ...

        this.app.module('Items', ItemModule);
      ```
    * `ui` hash interpolation now supports a functional `ui` hash.

      ```js
        ui: function() {
          return {
            "foo": ".foo"
          }
        }
      ```
  * Fixes
    * Fix `@ui` interpolation for handling complex selectors.

      ```js
        {
          "click div:not(@ui.bar)": "tapper"
        }
      ```
    * Bump `backbone.babysitter` and `backbone.wreqr` versions.
  * General
    * Improve readme docs for `CollectionView`, `AppRouter` and `ItemView`.

      "render": function() {
        console.log("an itemView has been rendered");
      }
    }
    ```

  * Massive perf boost in rendering collection and composite views by using document fragments [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/marionette-documentfragment-collectionview/5)

### v1.2.3 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3)
* CompositeView
  * Fixed bug where ```child views``` were being added before the initial render, thus raising errors.

### v1.2.2 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.2.1...v1.2.2)
* Views
	* Move the instantiation of ```view``` options above the ```constructor``` This allows for view options to be accessed from within the ```initialize``` method for a given ```view```
This is needed since backbone views no longer set the view options in the constructor

### v1.2.1 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.1)
* Views
  * fixed a bug so now view options are {} by default and not undefined.

  * Template helpers can now be provided as a constructor function option

* Layout
  * Will properly attach regions if the layout's `close` method was called prior to `render`

* RegionManager
  * Fixed a bug to decrement the `.length` when a region is removed

### v1.0.2 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2)

* UI Elements
  * Fix bug to unbind them after the "close" event / `onClose` method, so the `ui` elements are available during these

  * Fix bug that was reversing the order of routes, causing the wrong route to be fired in many cases

### v1.0.1 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)

* AMD build: Removed `require('jQuery')` as Marionette now pulled `Backbone.$` as
    `Marionette.$`.

* Fixed RegionManager to allow region types to be specified again, not just
  region instances.

* NPM: Removed hard dependency on jQuery from the dependency list. This will
  be pulled in by other libs, or should be pulled in manually, to get the
  right version.

### v1.0.0 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.0.0-rc6...v1.0.0)

* RegionManager
  * Created new `Marionette.RegionManager` object to manage a set of regions

* Region
  * Region will call the `close` method on a view, or the `remove` method if `close` is not found, when closing a view
  * When calling the `show` method with the same view instance multiple times, subsequent calls will only re-render the view and not close / re-open it

* Application
  * Now uses `Marionette.RegionManager` to manage regions

* Layout
  * Now uses `Marionette.RegionManager` to manage regions
  * Now supports dynamic add / remove of regions
  * Can specify `regions` as a function that takes an `options` argument (the view's constructor options)

* CollectionView / CompositeView
  * When specifying `itemViewOptions` as a function, an item `index` argument will be passed as the second parameter
  * Will call the `close` or `remove` method when closing a view, with `close` method taking precedence

* CompositeView
  * Fixed a bug that caused an error when the collection was `reset` (loaded) before the view was rendered

* All Views
  * Closing a view will properly unbind `ui` elements
  * Closing and then re-rendering a view will re-bind the `ui` elements

* Functions
  * Removed the `Marionette.createObject` function - it was never used by Marionette, directly

* jQuery
  * Replaced direct calls to `$` with new `Marionette.$`, which is assigned to
    `Backbone.$` for consistency w/ Backbone.

* Backbone.Wreqr
  * Updated to v0.2.0
  * Renamed `addHandler` method to `setHandler`
  * For more information, see the [Wreqr changelog](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

* Code Cleanup
  * Replaced `that = this` with the `context` param of several calls to `_.each` to clean up the code

  * **BREAKING:** Removed `Marionette.EventAggregator` object. Use `Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator` instead

* CollectionView / CompositeView
  * Fixed several issues related to resetting the collection, and producing zombie "empty" views
  * Fixed a bug that caused multiple emptyView instances when resetting the collection
  * Forwarded events from child views are now called with `triggerMethod`, meaning they trigger the event and call the corresponding "onEventName" method

* Modules
  * Finalizers now run with the module as the `this` context

* Marionette.getOption
  * Fixed support for "falsey" values in an object's `options`

* Build process
  * Fixed build process to work on case-sensitive file systems (Linux, for example)

* Controller
  * Added a very basic `Marionette.Controller` object, and basic documentation for it

* Marionette.getOption
  * Added a convience method to get an object's options either from the object directly, or from it's `this.options`, with `this.options` taking precedence

* Region
  * Fixed "show" method so that it includes the view instance being shown, again

### v1.0.0-beta2 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.0.0-beta1...v1.0.0-beta2)

* templateHelpers
  * **BREAKING:** Changed when the templateHelpers is mixed in to the data for a view, so that it is no longer dependent on the `serializeData` implementation

* Region
  * **BREAKING:** Changed "view:show" event to "show"
  * **BREAKING:** Changed "view:closed" event to "close"
  * All region events and events that the triggers from a view are now triggered via Marionette.triggerMethod.

* Marionette.EventAggregator
  * **BREAKING:** The `bindTo` method no longer assumes you are binding to the EventAggregator instance. You must specify the object that is triggering the event: `ea.bindto(ea, "event", callback, context)`
  * Marionette.EventAggregator combines Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator with Backbone.EventBinder, allowing the event aggregator to act as it's own event binder

* CollectionView
  * Fixed bug where adding an item to a collection would not allow the CollectionView to propagate the itemView's events
  * Allow `itemViewOptions` to be specified in CollectionView constructor options

* Application
  * The events triggered from the Application object instance are now triggered with corresponding "on{EventName}" method calls

* Backbone.EventBinder
  * Updated to v0.1.0 of Backbone.EventBinder, allowing for jQuery/DOM events to be handled within the EventBinder instances / `bindTo` methods

* AMD Wrapper
  * The "core" AMD wrapper specifies Backbone.Wreqr and Backbone.EventBinder
  * The "standard" AMD wrapper does not specify Backbone.Wreqr / EventBinder, as these are built in

* Build / downloads
  * The standard and AMD versions of `backbone.marionette.js` and `backbone.marionette.min.js` include all dependencies (EventBinder, Wreqr)
  * The "core" versions of `backbone.marionette.js` and `backbone.marionette.min.js` do not include any dependencies (EventBinder, Wreqr)

### v1.0.0-beta1 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.10.2...v1.0.0-beta1)

* Backbone.Wreqr
  * **BREAKING:** Marionette's EventAggregator has been extracted to the Backbone.Wreqr repository and plugin. You must include this file in your app, available at https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr

* All Views
  * **BREAKING:** `beforeRender` method is now `onBeforeRender`
  * **BREAKING:** `beforeClose` method is now `onBeforeClose`
  * **BREAKING:** The `render` method for all Marionette views is bound to the view instance
  * All view events are now triggered with `triggerMethod`, calling their corresponding method on the view if it exists
  * All views now have an `isClosed` attribute on them, which is set to `true` when calling the `close()` method and reset to `false` when calling the `render()` method
  * EventBinder is now attached to the views with the `Marionette.addEventBinder` method call

* CompositeView
  * **BREAKING:** CompositeView will only render a model in to it's template, instead of a model or collection. It will still render the collection as itemView instances.

* Modules
  * **BREAKING:** Split module definitions can now receive custom args per module definition, instead of sharing / replacing them across all definitions

* CollectionView / CompositeView
  * Cleaned up the `getItemViewContainer` code, and improved the error that is thrown when the specified container element is not found
  * Can attach existing view instance w/ existing DOM element as child of collection view / composite view, in parent's `initialize` function
  * Fixed a bug where an undefined `this.options` would prevent child views from being rendered, trying to find the index of the view

* Layout
  * Allow a Layout to be defined without `regions`, using Underscore v1.4.x

* View / ItemView / CompositeView
  * Removed the `serializeData` method and added directly to `ItemView` and `CompositeView` as needed

* Application
  * Application regions can now be specified as a jQuery selector string, a region type, or an object literal with a selector and type: `{selector: "#foo", regionType: MyCustomRegion}`
  * added `.commands` as instance of Backbone.Wreqr.Commands, to facilitate command execution
  * added `.execute` method for direct command execution
  * added `.reqres` as instance of Backbone.Wreqr.RequestResponse, to facilitate request/response execution
  * added `.request` method for direct requesting of a response

* Marionette.triggerMethod
  * Added `Marionette.triggerMethod` method to trigger an event and call the corresponding method. For example, `view.triggetMethod("before:render")` will trigger the "before:render" event and call the `onBeforeRender` method.

* Marionette.addEventBinder
  * Added `Marionette.addEventBinder` method to add all of the Backbone.Wreqr.EventBinder methods to a specified target object

* Misc
  * Added `Marionette.extend` as alias to Backbone's `extend` method for more consistent use

* Modules
  * **BREAKING:** Module definition functions are executed immediately and only once, not every time you call `start`

  * **BREAKING:** Sub-modules rely on the parent module to start them, by default, but can be started manually
  * **BREAKING:** Sub-modules default to starting with their parent module start
  * **BREAKING:** Specifying `startWithParent: false` for a sub-module will prevent the module from being started when the parent starts
  * **BREAKING:** Specifying `startWithParent: false` for a top-level module will prevent the module from being started when the parent `Application` starts
  * **BREAKING:** When starting a module, sub-modules will be started / initialized before parent modules (depth-first hierarchy traversal)
  * **BREAKING:** When stopping a module, sub-modules will be stopped / finalized before parent modules (depth-first hierarchy traversal)
  * Fixed: retrieving a module by name (`var foo = MyApp.module("Foo");`) will not change the module's definition or `startWithParent` setting

  * App.start sends options to module initializers
  * Modules that are defined (or loaded from external source) afer app is started will auto-start by default
  * Can specify a module is not started with the app, to prevent the module from being started when app.start is called
