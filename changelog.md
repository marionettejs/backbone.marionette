### v0.11.0 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.10.2...dev)

* CompositeView
  * **BREAKING:** CompositeView will only render a model in to it's template, instead of a model or collection. It will still render the collection as itemView instances.

* All Views
  * **BREAKING:** Calling `close` on a view multiple times will only close the view once. Subsequent calls will exit the close method with no operation occuring.

* View / ItemView / CompositeView
  * Removed the `serializeData` method from `View` and added directly to `ItemView` and `CompositeView` as needed

* CollectionView / CompositeView
  * Cleaned up the `getItemViewContainer` code, and improved the error that is thrown when the specified container element is not found

* Misc
  * jQuery ($) support now works from global `$` or `window.jQuery`

### v0.10.2 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.10.1...v0.10.2)

* Callbacks
  * Fixed a bug that caused callbacks to fire multiple times after calling `reset`

* Layout
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the regions from being re-initialized correctly, when using `render` as a callback method for an event

### v0.10.1 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1)

* Modules
  * Fixed a bug when defining modules in reverse order, that prevented `startWithParent` from working correctly

### v0.10.0 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.9.13...v0.10.0)

* Modules
  * **BREAKING:** Module definition functions are executed immediately and only once, not every time you call `start`
  * **BREAKING:** Renamed `startWithApp` to `startWithParent` in module definitions
  * **BREAKING:** Sub-modules rely on the parent module to start them, by default, but can be started manually
  * **BREAKING:** Sub-modules default to starting with their parent module start
  * **BREAKING:** Specifying `startWithParent: false` for a sub-module will prevent the module from being started when the parent starts
  * **BREAKING:** Specifying `startWithParent: false` for a top-level module will prevent the module from being started when the parent `Application` starts
  * **BREAKING:** When starting a module, sub-modules will be started / initialized before parent modules (depth-first hierarchy traversal)
  * **BREAKING:** When stopping a module, sub-modules will be stopped / finalized before parent modules (depth-first hierarchy traversal)
  * Fixed: retrieving a module by name (`var foo = MyApp.module("Foo");`) will not change the module's definition or `startWithParent` setting

* CollectionView
  * Allow `itemViewOptions` to be a function, which recieves the `item` as an argument

* Callbacks
  * Added `reset` method to reset the list of callbacks and allow them to be run again, when needed

### v0.9.13 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.9.12...v0.9.13)

### v0.9.8 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.9.7...v0.9.8)

* Modules
  * Fixed a bug that ensures modules will start and stop the correct number of times, instead of always stopping immediately after they have been stopped once

### v0.9.7 [view commit logs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v0.9.6...v0.9.7)

* Modules
  * Fixed a bug to ensure modules are only started once, no matter how many definitions the module is split in to

* View Templates
  * Better support for pre-compiled templates - can specify a function as the `template` setting for a view, and the function will be run as the template, directly.

  * Modules are automatically started when Marionette.Application `start` method is called
  * App.start sends options to module initializers
  * Modules that are defined (or loaded from external source) afer app is started will auto-start by default
  * Can specify a module is not started with the app, to prevent the module from being started when app.start is called
  * Calling `start` on a module will start all of the sub-modules for that module

* CollectionView/CompositeView
  * Correctly handles non-existent collection and removing child item views that were added manually
  * Corrected showing empty view and closing empty view when resetting collection and adding items
  * Fixed bug to prevent showing the empty view more than once when rendering the collection view

* Application
  * Added a `removeRegion` method to close / remove regions, as a counter-function to the `addRegions` method

  * Fixed a memory leak for closed item views
  * ItemView is now guaranteed to have it's "onRender" and "onShow" methods called, when rendering the collection and when adding a new item to the collection / rendering the new item view
  * Calls an `onItemAdded` method when adding an item/item view, just prior to rendering the item view
  * Can now specify an `itemViewOptions` object literal on your collection view definition, and the data will be passed to each itemView instance as part of the itemView's options
  * The `appendHtml` method receives a third argument of the itemView's "index" for sorted collections

* Callbacks:
  * **BREAKING** Switched the order of parameters for the `run` method to `args, context`

* BindTo:
  * The unbinding of an event now considers the `context` parameter when unbinding, allowing multiple handers to be bound to the same event from the same object, and unbinding only one of them
