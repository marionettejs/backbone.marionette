# Backbone Radio

The Backbone Radio provides easy support for a number of messaging patterns for
Backbone and Marionette. This is provided through two basic constructs:

* Events - trigger events on a global object
* Requests - a global request/reply implementation

Radio takes these two constructs and adds the channel implementation - providing
namespaces for events and requests. In short, Radio is a global, namespaced,
message bus system designed to allow two otherwise unrelated objects to
communicate and share information.

## Radio Concepts

The `Radio` message bus exposes some core concepts:

* `Channel` - a namespace mechanism.
* `Event` - alert other parts of your application that something happened.
* `Request` - execute single functions in a different part of your application.

### Channel

The `channel` is the biggest reason to use `Radio` as our event aggregator - it
provides a clean point for dividing global events. To retrieve a channel, use
`Radio.channel(channelName)`:

```javascript
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var myChannel = Radio.channel('basic');

myChannel.on('some:event', function() {
  // ...
});
```

The channel is accessible everywhere in your application. Simply import Radio
and call `channel()` to add listeners, fire callbacks, or send requests.

```javascript
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var someChannel = Radio.channel('basic');  // Exactly the same channel as above

someChannel.trigger('some:event');  // Will fire the function call above
```

[Live example](https://jsfiddle.net/marionettejs/0bejfju0/)


### Event

The `Radio Event` works exactly the same way as regular `Backbone Events`
like model/collection events. In fact, it uses the `Backbone.Events` mixin
internally, exposing its API:

* `channel.on('event', callback, [context])` - when `event` fires, call `callback`
* `channel.once('event', callback, [context])` - same as `on`, but triggered only once
* `channel.off('event')` - stop listening to event
* `channel.trigger('event', ..args)` - fires `event` and passes  args into the
  resulting `callback`

Events are typically used to alert other parts of the system that something
happened. For example, a user login expired or the user performed a specific
action.

As the Radio can be imported anywhere, we can use it as a global event
aggregator as such:

```javascript
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var myChannel = Radio.channel('star');

myChannel.on('left:building', function(person) {
  console.log(person.get('name') + ' has left the building!');
});

var elvis = new Bb.Model({name: 'Elvis'});
myChannel.trigger('left:building', elvis);

myChannel.off('left:building');
```

Just like Backbone Events, the Radio respects the `listenTo` handler as well:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var starChannel = Radio.channel('star');

var Star = Mn.Object.extend({

  initialize: function() {
    this.listenTo(starChannel, 'left:building', this.leftBuilding);
    this.listenTo(starChannel, 'enter:building', function(person) {
       console.log(person.get('name') + ' has entered the building!');
    });
  },

  leftBuilding: function(person) {
    console.log(person.get('name') + ' has left the building!');
  }
});
```

Note that the event handler can be defined as a method like used for
'left:building' event or inline like used in 'enter:building'.

[Live example](https://jsfiddle.net/marionettejs/s8nff8vz/)

As in Backbone, the event handler is called with `this` bound to the `Star` instance. See the
[Backbone documentation](http://backbonejs.org/#Events) for the full list of
Event handling methods.

#### When to use Events

The Event is a simple notification that _something happened_ and you may or may
not want other objects in your application to react to that. A few key
principles to bear in mind are:

* If you don't know what could act on the event, or don't care, use an `Event`
* If you find yourself calling it an action that occurred, use an `Event`
* If it's fine for many objects to perform an action, use an `Event`
* If you don't mind that no objects react, use an `Event`

If your use case isn't covered here, consider whether you want to
[use a request](#when-to-use-requests) instead.

### Request

The Request API provides a uniform way for unrelated parts of the system to
communicate with each other. For example, displaying notifications in response
to system activity. To attach a listener to a request channel, use `reply` or
`replyOnce` to attach a listener that immediately detaches after one call.

As with request, any arguments passed in `channel.request` will be passed into
the callback.

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var channel = Radio.channel('notify');

var Notification = Mn.Object.extend({

  initialize: function() {
    channel.reply('show:success', this.showSuccessMessage);
    channel.reply('show:error', function(msg) {
       // ...
    });
  },

  showSuccessMessage: function(msg) {
    // ...
  }
});
```

So, for example, when a model sync fails:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var channel = Radio.channel('notify');

var ModelView = Mn.View.extend({
  modelEvents: {
    error: 'showErrorMessage'
  },

  showErrorMessage: function() {
    channel.request('show:error', 'An error occurred contacting the server');
  }
});
```

[Live example](https://jsfiddle.net/marionettejs/4uuyLe1q/)

Now, whenever the model attached to this View is unable to sync with the server,
we can display an error message to the user.

### Returning Values from Reply

The Request API is also able to return values, making it extremely useful for
accessing objects that would be otherwise difficult to access. As an example,
let's assume we attach the currently logged-in user to the `Application` object
and we want to know if they're still logged-in.

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var channel = Radio.channel('user');

var App = Mn.Application.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    channel.reply('user:logged:in', this.isLoggedIn);
  },

  isLoggedIn: function() {
    return this.model.getLoggedIn();
  }
});
```

Then, from another view, instead of trying to find the User model. we simply
`request` it:

```javascript
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');

var channel = Radio.channel('user');

var loggedIn = channel.request('user:logged:in');  // App.model.getLoggedIn()
```

[Live example](https://jsfiddle.net/marionettejs/zaje1rLj/)

### When to use Requests

A Request is, as you might guess, a request for information or for something to
happen. You will probably want to use requests when:

* You call the request an action to perform e.g. `show:notification`
* You want to get the return value of the request
* You want to call _exactly one_ function


In addition to this documentation, the Radio documentation can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.radio).


## Marionette Integration

The `Marionette.Object` class provides bindings to provide automatic event
listeners and / or request replies on your object instances. This works with
a bound `channelName` to let us provide listeners using the `radioEvents` and
`radioRequests` properties.  Anything that extends from `Mn.Object` has
access to this API.

### API

 * `channelName` - defines the Radio channel that will be used for the requests and/or events
 * `getChannel()` - returns a Radio.Channel instance using `channelName`
 * `radioEvents` - defines an events hash with the events to be listened and its respective handlers
 * `radioRequests` - defines an events hash with the requests to be replied and its respective handlers

### Examples

#### Listening to events in an object

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var Star = Mn.Object.extend({
  channelName: 'star',

  radioEvents: {
    'left:building': 'leftBuilding'
  },

  leftBuilding: function(person) {
    console.log(person.get('name') + ' has left the building!');
  }
});
```

[Live example](https://jsfiddle.net/marionettejs/tf9467x4/)

This gives us a clear definition of how this object interacts with the `star`
radio channel.


#### Replying to requests in a object

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var Notification = Mn.Object.extend({
  channelName: 'notify',

  radioRequests: {
    'show:success': 'showSuccessMessage',
    'show:error': 'showErrorMessage'
  },

  showSuccessMessage: function(msg) {
    // ...
  },

  showErrorMessage: function(msg) {
    // ...
  }
});
```

[Live example](https://jsfiddle.net/marionettejs/j2qgfk3s/)

We now have a clear API for communicating with the `Notification` across the
application. Don't forget to define the `channelName` on your `Object`
definition.

As with a normal request/reply, we can return values from these bound handlers:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var App = Mn.Application.extend({
  channelName: 'user',

  radioRequests: {
    'user:logged:in': 'isLoggedIn'
  },

  isLoggedIn: function() {
    return this.model.getLoggedIn();
  }
});
```

[Live example](https://jsfiddle.net/marionettejs/52rpd3zg/)


#### Events and requests in same object

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var NotificationHandler = Mn.Object.extend({
  channelName: 'notify',

  radioRequests: {
    'show:success': 'showSuccessMessage',
    'show:error': 'showErrorMessage'
  },

  radioEvents: {
    'user:logged:in': 'showProfileButton',
    'user:logged:out': 'hideProfileButton'
  },

  showSuccessMessage: function(message) {
    // ...
  },

  showErrorMessage: function(message) {
    // ...
  },

  showProfileButton: function(user) {
    // ...
  },

  hideProfileButton: function(user) {
    // ...
  }
});
```

In an unrelated module:

```javascript
var Radio = require('backbone.radio');
var User = require('./models/user');

var notifyChannel = Radio.channel('notify');
var userModel = new User();

// The following will call Notification.showErrorMessage(message)
notifyChannel.request('show:error', 'A generic error occurred!');

// The following will call Notification.showProfileButton(user)
notifyChannel.trigger('user:logged:in', userModel);
```
