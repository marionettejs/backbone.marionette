# Installing Marionette

As with all JavaScript libraries, there are a number of ways to get started with
a Marionette application. In this section we'll cover the most common ways.


## Quick start using NPM and Webpack

[Webpack][webpack] is a build tool that makes it easy to pull your dependencies
together into a single bundle to be delivered to your browser's `<script>` tag.
It works particularly well with Marionette and jQuery.

[Here](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette-integrations/tree/master/webpack) 
we prepared simple marionettejs skeleton with Webpack.


## Quick start using NPM and Brunch

[Brunch][brunch] is fast front-end web app build tool with simple declarative config, 
seamless incremental compilation for rapid development, an opinionated pipeline 
and workflow, and core support for source maps.

[Here](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette-integrations/tree/master/brunch)
we prepared simple marionettejs skeleton with Brunch. 


## Quick start using NPM and Browserify

[Browserify][browserify] is a build tool that makes it easy to bundle NPM
modules into your application, so you can `require` them as you would import
dependencies in any other language.

[Here](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette-integrations/tree/master/browserify)
we prepared simple marionettejs skeleton with Browserify.
