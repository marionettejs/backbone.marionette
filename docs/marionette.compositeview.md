# Marionette.CompositeView

A `CompositeView` extends from `CollectionView` to be used as a 
composite view for scenarios where it should represent both a 
branch and leaf in a tree structure, or for scenarios where a
collection needs to be rendered within a wrapper template.

For example, if you're rendering a treeview control, you may 
want to render a collection view with a model and template so 
that it will show a parent item with children in the tree.

You can specify a `modelView` to use for the model. If you don't
specify one, it will default to the `Marionette.ItemView`.

```js
CompositeView = Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  template: "#leaf-branch-template"
});

new CompositeView({
  model: someModel,
  collection: someCollection
});
```

## Composite Model `template`

When a `CompositeView` is rendered, the `model` will be rendered
with the `template` that the view is configured with. You can
override the template by passing it in as a constructor option:

```js
new MyComp({
  template: "#some-template"
});
```

## CompositeView's `itemViewContainer`

By default the composite view uses the same `appendHtml` method that the
collection view provides. This means the view will call jQuery's `.append` 
to move the HTML contents from the item view instance in to the collection
view's `el`. 

This is typically not very useful as a composite view will usually render
a container DOM element in which the item views should be placed.

For example, if you are building a table view, and want to append each
item from the collection in to the `<tbody>` of the table, you might
do this with a template:

```html
<script id="row-template" type="text/html">
  <td><%= someData %></td>
  <td><%= moreData %></td>
  <td><%= stuff %></td>
</script>

<script id="table-template" type="text/html">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Some Column</th>
        <th>Another Column</th>
        <th>Still More</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>

    <!-- want to insert collection items, here -->
    <tbody></tbody>

    <tfoot>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="3">some footer information</td>
      </tr>
    </tfoot>
  </table>
</script>
```

To get your itemView instances to render within the `<tbody>` of this
table structure, specify an `itemViewContainer` in your composite view,
like this:

```js
RowView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  tagName: "tr",
  template: "#row-template"
});

TableView = Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  itemView: RowView,

  // specify a jQuery selector to put the itemView instances in to
  itemViewContainer: "tbody",

  template: "#table-template"
});
```

This will put all of the `itemView` instances in to the `<tbody>` tag of
the composite view's rendered template, correctly producing the table
structure.

Alternatively, you can specify a function as the `itemViewContainer`. This
function needs to return a jQuery selector string, or a jQuery selector
object.

```js
TableView = Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  // ...

  itemViewContainer: function(){
    return "#tbody"
  }
});
```

Using a function allows for logic to be used for the selector. However,
only one value can be returned. Upon returning the first value, it will
be cached and that value will be used for the remainder of that view
instance' lifecycle.

## CompositeView's `appendHtml`


Sometimes the `itemViewContainer` configuration is insuficient for
specifying where the itemView instance should be placed. If this is the
case, you can override the `appendHtml` method with your own implementation.

For example:

```js
TableView = Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  itemView: RowView,

  template: "#table-template",

  appendHtml: function(collectionView, itemView, index){
    collectionView.$("tbody").append(itemView.el);
  }
});
```

For more information on the parameters of this method, see the
[CollectionView's documentation](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.collectionview.md).

## Recursive By Default

The default rendering mode for a `CompositeView` assumes a
hierarchical, recursive structure. If you configure a composite
view without specifying an `itemView`, you'll get the same
composite view type rendered for each item in the collection. If
you need to override this, you can specify a `itemView` in the
composite view's definition:

```js
var ItemView = Backbone.Marionette.ItemView.extend({});

var CompView = Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  itemView: ItemView
});
```

## Model And Collection Rendering

The model and collection for the composite view will re-render
themselves under the following conditions:

* When the collection's "reset" event is fired, it will only re-render the collection within the composite, and not the wrapper template
* When the collection has a model added to it (the "add" event is fired), it will render that one item to the rendered list
* When the collection has a model removed (the "remove" event is fired), it will remove that one item from the rendered list

You can also manually re-render either or both of them:

* If you want to re-render everything, call the `.render()` method
* If you want to re-render the model's view, you can call `.renderModel()`
* If you want to re-render the collection's views, you can call `.renderCollection()`

## Events And Callbacks

During the course of rendering a composite, several events will
be triggered. These events are triggered with the [Marionette.triggerMethod](./marionette.functions.md)
function, which calls a corresponding "on{EventName}" method on the view.

* "composite:item:rendered" / `onCompositeItemRendered` - after the `modelView` has been rendered
* "composite:collection:rendered" / `onCompositeCollectionRendered` - after the collection of models has been rendered
* "render" / `onRender` and "composite:rendered" / `onCompositeRendered` - after everything has been rendered

Additionally, after the composite view has been rendered, an 
`onRender` method will be called. You can implement this in 
your view to provide custom code for dealing with the view's 
`el` after it has been rendered:

```js
Backbone.Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  onRender: function(){
    // do stuff here
  }
});
```

## Organizing UI elements

Similar to ItemView, you can organize the UI elements inside the
CompositeView by specifying them in the `UI` hash. It should be
noted that the elements that can be accessed via this hash are
the elements that are directly rendered by the composite view
template, not those belonging to the collection.

The UI elements will be accessible as soon as the composite view
template is rendered (and before the collection is rendered),
which means you can even access them in the `onBeforeRender` method.

## modelEvents and collectionEvents

CompositeViews can bind directly to model events and collection events
in a declarative manner:

```js
Marionette.CompositeView.extend({
  modelEvents: {
    "change": "modelChanged"
  },

  collectionEvents: {
    "add": "modelAdded"
  }
});
```
