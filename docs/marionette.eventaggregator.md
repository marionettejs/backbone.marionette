# Marionette.EventAggregator

An event aggregator is an application level pub/sub mechanism that allows various
pieces of an otherwise segmented and disconnected system to communicate with
each other. 

Marionette's EventAggregator is facilitated by 
[Backbone.Wreqr](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr)'s
EventAggregator object and 
[Backbone.EventBinder](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.eventbinder).
It combines an EventBinder in to the EventAggregator instance.

## Basic Usage

Marionette provides an event aggregator with each application instance: 
`MyApp.vent`. You can also instantiate your own event aggregator:

```js
myVent = new Marionette.EventAggregator();
```

Passing an object literal of options to the constructor function will extend the
event aggregator with those options:

```js
myVent = new Marionette.EventAggregator({foo: "bar"});
myVent.foo // => "bar"
```

## BindTo

The `EventAggregator` mixes in an [EventBinder](./marionette.eventbinder.md) object to easily track
and unbind all event callbacks, including inline callback functions. 

```js
vent = new Marionette.EventAggregator();

vent.bindTo(vent, "foo", function(){
  alert("bar");
});

vent.unbindAll();

vent.trigger("foo"); // => nothing. all events have been unbound.
```

## Decoupling With An Event-Driven Architecture

You can use an event aggregator to communicate between various modules of your
application, ensuring correct decoupling while also facilitating functionality
that needs more than one of your application's modules.

```js
var vent = new Marionette.EventAggregator();

vent.on("some:event", function(){
  alert("Some event was fired!!!!");
});
  
vent.trigger("some:event");
```
