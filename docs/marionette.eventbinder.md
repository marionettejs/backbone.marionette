# Marionette.EventBinder

The `EventBinder` object provides event binding management for related
events, across any number of objects that trigger the events. This allows
events to be grouped together and unbound with a single call during the 
clean-up of an object that is bound to the events.

## Bind Events

```js
var binder = new Backbone.Marionette.EventBinder();

var model = new MyModel();

var handler = {
  doIt: function(){}
}
binder.bindTo(model, "change:foo", handler.doIt);
```

You can optionally specify a 4th parameter as the context in which the callback
method for the event will be executed:

```js
binder.bindTo(model, "change:foo", someCallback, someContext);
```

## Unbind A Single Event

When you call `bindTo`, it returns a "binding" object that can be
used to unbind from a single event with the `unbindFrom` method:

```js
var binding = binder.bindTo(model, "change:foo", someCallback, someContext);

// later in the code
binder.unbindFrom(binding);
```

This will unbind the event that was configured with the binding
object, and remove it from the EventBinder bindings.

## Unbind All Events

You can call `unbindAll` to unbind all events that were bound with the
`bindTo` method:

```js
binder.unbindAll();
```

This even works with in-line callback functions.
