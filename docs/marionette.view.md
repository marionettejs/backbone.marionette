# Marionette.View

A `View` is a view that represents an item to be displayed with a template.This is typically a `Backbone.Model`, `Backbone.Collection`, or nothing at all.Views are also used to build up your application hierarchy - you can easily nestmultiple views through the `regions` attribute.**_Note: From Marionette v3.x, `Marionette.View` replaces
`Marionette.LayoutView` and `Marionette.ItemView`._**

## Rendering a Template

The Marionette View implements a powerful render method which, given a template,
will build your HTML from that template, mixing in model information and any
extra template context.

**Overriding `render`** If you want to add extra behavior to your view's render,
you would be best off doing your logic in the
[`onBeforeRender` or `onRender` handlers](#lifecycle-events).

### Passing a Template

The `Marionette.View` looks for the attached template on the `template`
attribute. Like most attributes in Backbone and Marionette, this takes a string
(selector) or function.

#### Template Selector

If your index page contains a pre-formatted template, you can simply pass in the
jQuery selector for it to `template` and Marionette will look it up:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

export.MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: '#template-layout'
});
```

```html
<script id="template-layout" type="x-template/underscore">
<h1>Hello, world</h1>
</script>
```

Marionette will look up the template above and render it for you when `MyView`
gets rendered.

#### Template Function

A more common way of setting a template is to assign a function to `template`
that renders its argument. This will commonly be the `_.template` function:

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

export.MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<h1>Hello, world</h1>')
});
```

This doesn't have to be an underscore template, you can pass your own rendering
function:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

export.MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: function(data) {
    if (data.name) {
      return _.template('<h1>Hello, <%- name %></h1>')(data);
    }
    return '<h1>Hello, world</h1>';
  }
});
```

Using a custom function can give you a lot of control over the output of your
view, let you switch templates, or just add extra data to the context passed
into your template.

### Using a Model

Marionette will happily render a template without a model. This won't give us a
particularly interesting result. As with Backbone, we can attach a model to our
views and render the data they represent:

```javascript
var Backbone = require('backbone');
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    name: 'world'
  }
});

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<h1>Hello, <%- name %></h1>')
});

var myView = new MyView({model: new MyModel()});
```

Now our template has full access to the attributes on the model passed into the
view.

### Using a Collection

The `Marionette.View` also provides a simple tool for rendering collections into
a template. Simply pass in the collection as `collection` and Marionette will
provide an `items` attribute to render:

```javascript
var Backbone = require('backbone');
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
});

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: '#hello-template'
});

var collection = new MyCollection([
  {name: 'Steve'}, {name: 'Helen'}
]);

var myView = new MyView({collection: collection});
```

For clarity, we've moved the template into this script tag:

```html
<script id="hello-template" type="x-template/underscore">
<ul>
  <% _.each(items, function(item) { %>
  <li><%- item.name %></li>
  <% }) %>
</ul>
</script>
```

As you can see, `items` is provided to the template representing each record in
the collection.

### User interaction with Collection records

While possible, reacting to user interaction with individual items in your
collection is tricky with just a `View`. If you want to act on individual items,
it's recommended that you use [`CollectionView`](./marionette.collectionview.md)
and handle the behavior at the individual item level.

### Rendering a Model or Collection

Marionette uses a simple method to determine whether to make a model or
collection available to the template:

1. If `view.model` is set, the attributes from `model`
2. If `view.model` is not set, but `view.collection` is, set `items` to the
  individual items in the collection
3. If neither are set, an empty object is used

The result of this is mixed into the
[`templateContext` object](#template-context) and made available to your
template. Using this means you can setup a wrapper `View` that can act on
`collectionEvents` but will render its `model` attribute - if your `model` has
and `items` attribute then that will always be used.

### Template Context

The `Marionette.View` provides a `templateContext` attribute that is used to add
extra information to your templates. This can be either an object, or a function
returning an object. The keys on the returned object will be mixed into the
model or collection keys and made available to the template.

#### Context Object

Using the context object, simply attach an object to `templateContext` as so:

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<h1>Hello, <%- contextKey %></h1>'),

  templateContext: {
    contextKey: 'world'
  }
});

var myView = new MyView();
```

The `myView` instance will be rendered without errors even though we have no
model or collection - `contextKey` is provided by `templateContext`.

#### Context Function

The `templateContext` object can also be a function returning an object. This is
useful when you want to access
[information from the surrounding view](#binding-of-this) (e.g. model methods).

To use a `templateContext`, simply assign a function:

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<h1>Hello, <%- contextKey %></h1>'),

  templateContext: function() {
    return {
      contextKey: this.getOption('contextKey')
    }
  }
});

var myView = new MyView({contextKey: 'world'});
```

Here, we've passed an option that can be accessed from the `templateContext`
function using `getOption()`. More information on `getOption` can be found in
the [documentation for `Marionette.Object`](./marionette.object.md#getoption).

#### Binding of `this`

When using functions in the `templateContext` it's important to know that `this`
is _bound to the `data` object and **not the view**_. An illustrative example:

```javascript
var _ = require('underscore');
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: _.template('<h1>Hello, <%- contextKey() %></h1>'),

  templateContext: {
    contextKey: function() {
      return this.getOption('contextKey');  // ERROR
    }
  }
});

var myView = new MyView({contextKey: 'world'});
```

The above code will fail because the context (`data`) object in the template
_cannot see_ the view's `getOption`.

## Managing an Existing Page

Marionette is able to manage pre-generated pages - either static or
server-generated - and treat them as though they were generated from Marionette.

To use the existing page, set the `template` attribute to `false`:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View({
  el: '#base-element',
  template: false
});
```

Marionette will then attach all the usual
[`event`](#events-and-callback-methods) and [`ui`](#organising-your-view)
handlers to the view using the existing HTML. Though the View has no template,
you can still listen to the `before:render` and `render` events that will fire
as usual when `render` is called - or when you execute `region.show(view)`.

### Setting a falsy `template` value

When using an existing page, Marionette explicitly looks for `false` - any other
falsy value will cause Marionette to raise an error when attempting to render
the template.

## Laying out Views - Regions

The `Marionette.View` class lets us manage a hierarchy of views using `regions`.
Regions are a hook point that lets us show views inside views, manage the
show/hide lifecycles, and act on events inside the children.

**This Section only covers the basics. For more information on regions, see the
[Regions Documentation.](./marionette.region.md)**


Regions are ideal for rendering application layouts by isolating concerns inside
another view. This is especially useful for independently re-rendering chunks
of your application without having to completely re-draw the entire screen every
time some data is updated.

Regions can be added to a View at class definition, with `regions`, or at
runtime using  `addRegion`.

### Class Definition

When you extend `View`, we use the `regions` attribute to point to the  selector
where the new view will be displayed:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
	template: '#tpl-view-with-regions',

	regions: {
		firstRegion: '#first-region',
		secondRegion: '#second-region'
	}
});
```

If we have the following template:

```html
<script type="x-template/underscore" id="tpl-view-with-regions">
  <div id="first-region"></div>
  <div id="second-region"></div>
  <div id="third-region"></div>
</script>
```

When we show views in the region, the contents of `#first-region` and
`#second-region` will be replaced with the contents of the view we show. The
value in the `regions` hash is just a jQuery selector, and any valid jQuery
syntax will suffice.

#### Specifying regions as functions

Regions can be specified on a View using a function that returns an object with
the region definitions. The returned object follow the same rules for defining a
region:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  regions: function(options){
    return {
      firstRegion: '#first-region'
    };
  }
});
```

The `options` argument contains the options passed to the view on instantiation.
As the view has not been constructed yet, `this.getOption()` is not able to
return any options from the view - use `options` instead.

### Adding Regions

To add regions to a view after it has been instantiated, simply use the
`addRegion` method:

```javascript
var MyView = require('./myview');

myView = new MyView();
myView.addRegion('thirdRegion', '#third-region');
```

Now we can access `thirdRegion` as we would the others.

### Managing Sub-views

`View` provides a simple interface for managing sub-views with `showChildView`
and `getChildView`:


#### Showing a view

To show a view inside a region, simply call `showChildView(region, view)`. This
will handle rendering the view's HTML and attaching it to the DOM for you:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');
var SubView = require('./subview');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: '#tpl-view-with-regions',

  regions: {
    firstRegion: '#first-region'
  },

  onRender: function() {
    this.showChildView('firstRegion', new SubView());
  }
});
```

#### Accessing a child view

To access the child view of a `View` - use the `getChildView(region)` method.
This will return the view instance that is current being displayed at that
region, or `null`:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');
var SubView = require('./subview');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: '#tpl-view-with-regions',

  regions: {
    firstRegion: '#first-region'
  },

  onRender: function() {
    this.showChildView('firstRegion', new SubView());
  },

  onSomeEvent: function() {
    var first = this.getChildView('firstRegion');
    first.doSomething();
  }
});
```

If no view is available, `getChildView` returns `null`.

### Region options
A `View` can take a `regions` hash that allows you to specify regions per `View` instance.

```javascript
new Marionette.View({
 regions: {
   "cat": ".doge",
   "wow": {
     selector: ".such",
     regionClass: Coin
   }
 }
});
```

### Region availability
Any defined regions within a `View` will be available to the `View` or any calling code immediately after instantiating the `View`. This allows a View to be attached to an existing DOM element in an HTML page, without the need to call a render method or anything else, to create the regions.

However, a region will only be able to populate itself if the `View` has access to the elements specified within the region definitions. That is, if your view has not yet rendered, your regions may not be able to find the element that you've specified for them to manage. In that scenario, using the region will result in no changes to the DOM.

### Efficient nested view structures
When your views get some more regions, you may want to think of the most efficient way to render your views. Since manipulating the DOM is performany heavy, it's best practice to render most of your views at once.

Marionette provides a simple mechanism to infinitely nest views in a single paint: just render all
of the children in the onBeforeShow callback.

```javascript
var ParentView = Marionette.View.extend({
  onBeforeShow: function() {
    this.showChildView('header', new HeaderView());
    this.showChildView('footer', new FooterView());
  }
});

myRegion.show(new ParentView(), options);
```
In this example, the doubly-nested view structure will be rendered in a single paint.

This system is recursive, so it works for any deeply nested structure. The child views
you show can render their own child views within their onBeforeShow callbacks!

### Listening to events on children

Using regions lets you listen to the events that fire on child views - views
attached inside a region. This lets a parent view take action depending on what
is happening in views it directly owns.

**To see more information about events, see the [events](#events) section**

#### Defining `childViewEvents`

The `childViewEvents` hash defines the events to listen to on a view's children
mapped to the method to call. The method will receive a `child` object
referencing the view that triggered the event.

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

let MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  regions: {
    product: '.product-hook'
  },

  childViewEvents: {
    'add:item': 'updateBasketValue'
  },

  /** Assume item is the model belonging to the child */
  updateBasketValue: function(child, item) {
    var initialValue = this.model.get('value');
    this.model.set({
      value: item.get('value') * item.get('quantity')
    });
  }
});
```

You can also directly define a function to call in `childViewEvents` like so:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

let MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  regions: {
    product: '.product-hook'
  },

  childViewEvents: {
    'add:item': function(child, item) {
      var initialValue = this.model.get('value');
      this.model.set({
        value: item.get('value') * item.get('quantity')
      });
    }
  }
});
```

## Organising your View

The `View` provides a mechanism to name parts of your template to be used
throughout the view with the `ui` attribute. This provides a number of benefits:

1. Provide a reference to commonly used UI elements
2. Cache the jQuery selector
3. Change the selector later in only one place in your view

### Defining `ui`

To define your `ui` hash, just set an object of key to jQuery selectors to the
`ui` attribute of your View:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: '#my-template',
  ui: {
    save: '#save-button',
    close: '.close-button'
  }
});
```

Inside your view, the `save` and `close` references will point to the jQuery
selectors `#save-button` and `.close-button` respectively.

### Accessing UI elements

To get the handles to your UI elements, use the `getUI(ui)` method:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: '#my-template',
  ui: {
    save: '#save-button',
    close: '.close-button'
  },

  onDoSomething: function() {
    var saveButton = this.getUI('save');
    saveButton.addClass('disabled');
    saveButton.attr('disabled', 'disabled');
  }
});
```

As `saveButton` here is a jQuery selector, you can call any jQuery methods on
it, according to the jQuery documentation.

#### Referencing UI in events

The UI attribute is especially useful when setting handlers in the
[`events`](#events-and-callback-methods) object, simply use the `@ui.*` prefix:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  template: '#my-template',
  ui: {
    save: '#save-button',
    close: '.close-button'
  },

  events: {
    'click @ui.save': 'handleSave'
  },

  triggers: {
    'click @ui.close': 'close:view'
  },

  handleSave: function() {
    this.model.save();
  }
});
```

By prefixing with `@ui`, we can change the underlying template without having to
hunt through our view for every place where that selector is referenced - just
update the `ui` object.

## Events

Firing events on views allows you to communicate that something has happened
on that view and allowing it to decide whether to act on it or not.

During the create/destroy lifecycle for a `View`, Marionette will call a number
of events on the view being created and attached. You can listen to these events
and act on them in two ways:

  1. The typical Backbone manner: `view.on('render', function() {})`
  2. Overriding the onEvent listener methods: `onRender: function() {}`

### onEvent Listeners

Marionette creates onEvent listeners for all events fired using
`view.triggerMethod('event')` - if there is an `onEvent` method, Marionette will
call it for you. An example:

```javascript
var Mn = require('backbone.marionette');

var MyView = Mn.View.extend({
  onRender: function() {
    console.log("Fired whenever view.triggerMethod('render') is called.");
  },

  onOtherEvent: function(argument) {
    console.log("Fired other:event with '" + argument + "' as an argument");
  }
});

var view = new MyView();

view.triggerMethod('other:event', 'test argument');
```

This will display in the console:
`Fired other:event with 'test argument' as an argument`

#### Rules for onEvent listeners

The onEvent listeners follow clearly defined rules for determining whether they
should be called:

  1. Split the event name around `:`
  2. Capitalize the first letter of each "word"
  3. Prepend `on` to the event name
  4. If the associated method exists, call it
  5. Any extra arguments passed to `triggerMethod` get passed in

A few simple examples:

  1. `triggerMethod('render')` calls `onRender()`
  2. `triggerMethod('before:render')` calls `onBeforeRender()`
  3. `triggerMethod('before:sync', model)` calls `onBeforeSync(model)`

### Lifecycle Events

Marionette views defined a number of events during the creation and destruction
lifecycle - when the view is displayed in and emptied from a region. In the
documentation, we will reference the event name, however every event here
respect the [rules for onEvent listeners](rules-for-onevent-listeners).

#### View Creation Lifecycle

When a view is initialized and then displayed inside a region (using
`showChildView()`) a set of events will be called in a specific order.

| Order |      Event      |
| :---: |-----------------|
|   1   | `before:render` |
|   2   | `render`        |
|   3   | `before:attach` |
|   4   | `attach`        |
|   5   | `dom:refresh`   |

#### View Destruction Lifecycle

When  `region.empty()` is called, the view will be destroyed, calling events as
part of the destruction lifecycle.

| Order |      Event      |
| :---: |-----------------|
|   1   | `before:detach` |
|   2   | `detach`        |
|   3   | `destroy`       |

#### View `before:render`

Triggered before an View is rendered.

```js
Marionette.View.extend({
  onBeforeRender: function() {
    // set up final bits just before rendering the view's `el`
  }
});
```

#### View `render`

Triggered after the view has been rendered.
You can implement this in your view to provide custom code for dealing
with the view's `el` after it has been rendered.

```js
Marionette.View.extend({
  onRender: function() {
    console.log('el exists but is not visible in the DOM');
  }
});
```

#### View `before:attach`

Triggered after the View has been rendered but just before it is first bound
into the page DOM. This will only be triggered once per `region.show()` - if
you want something that will be triggered every time the DOM changes,
you may want `render` or `before:render`.

#### View `attach`

Triggered once the View has been bound into the DOM. This is only triggered
once - the first time the View is attached to the DOM. If you want an event that
triggers every time the DOM changes visibly, you may want `dom:refresh`

#### View `dom:refresh`

Triggered after the first `attach` event fires _and_ every time the visible DOM
changes.

**Note for upgrading from Marionette 2** If you were using the `show` event -
the `dom:refresh` event may be a better event than `attach` when you want to be
sure something will run once your `el` has been attached to the DOM and updates.

#### View `before:destroy`

Triggered just prior to destroying the view, when the view's `destroy()` method has been called.

```js
Marionette.View.extend({
  onBeforeDestroy: function() {
    // manipulate the `el` here. it's already
    // been rendered, and is full of the view's
    // HTML, ready to go.
  }
});
```

#### View `detach`
The `View` will trigger the "detach" event when the view was rendered and has just been destroyed.

#### View `before:detach`
The `View` will trigger the "before:detach" event when the view is rendered and is about to be destroyed.
If the view has not been rendered before, this event will not be fired.

#### View `destroy`

Triggered just after the view has been destroyed.

```js
Marionette.View.extend({
  onDestroy: function() {
    // custom destroying and cleanup goes here
  }
});
```

#### `before:add:region` / `onBeforeAddRegion` event
The `View` will trigger a "before:add:region"
event before a region is added to the manager. This
allows you to perform some actions on the region before it is added.

#### `add:region` / `onAddRegion` event
The `RegionsMixin` will trigger an "add:region"
event when a region is added to the view. This
allows you to use the region instance immediately,
or attach the region to an object that needs a
reference to it:

```javascript
let view = new Marionette.View(),
	 myObject = {};

view.on("add:region", function(name, region) {
  // add the region instance to an object
  myObject[name] = region;
});

view.addRegion("foo", "#bar");
```

#### `before:remove:region` / `onBeforeRemoveRegion` event
The `View` will trigger a "before:remove:region"
event before a region is removed from the view.
This allows you to perform any cleanup operations before the region is removed.

```javascript
let view = new Marionette.View();

view.on("before:remove:region", function(name, region) {
  // do something with the region instance here
});

view.addRegion("foo", "#bar");

view.removeRegion("foo");
```

#### `remove:region` / `onRemoveRegion` event
The `View` will trigger a "remove:region"
event when a region is removed from the view.
This allows you to use the region instance one last
time, or remove the region from an object that has a
reference to it:

```javascript
let view = new Marionette.View();

view.on("remove:region", function(name, region) {
  // add the region instance to an object
  delete myObject[name];
});

view.addRegion("foo", "#bar");

view.removeRegion("foo");
```

## Model and Collection events

The Marionette View can bind to events that occur on attached models and
collections - this includes both [standard][backbone-events] and custom events.

### Model Events

For example, to listen to a model's events:

```javascript
var MyView = Marionette.View.extend({
  modelEvents: {
    'change:attribute': 'actOnChange'
  },

  actOnChange: function(value, model) {
    console.log('New value: ' + value);
  }
});
```

The `modelEvents` attribute passes through all the arguments that are passed
to `model.trigger('event', arguments)`.

#### Function callback

You can also bind a function callback directly in the `modelEvents` attribute:

```javascript
var MyView = Marionette.View.extend({
  modelEvents: {
    'change:attribute': function() {
      console.log('attribute was changed');
    }
  }
})
```

#### Attaching a function

As with most things in Backbone and Marionette, you can attach a function that
returns the object to to attach to `modelEvents`. This is particularly handy for
binding to events based on options passed into the view:

```javascript
var MyView = Marionette.View.extend({
  modelEvents: function() {
    var events = {};
    var fieldToListenTo = this.getOption('customField');
    events['change:' + fieldToListenTo] = 'customHandler';
    return events;
  },

  customHandler: function() {
    console.log('I will be called based on the value passed into customField');
  }
});
```

### Collection Events

```javascript
var MyView = Marionette.View.extend({
  collectionEvents: {
    sync: 'actOnSync'
  },

  actOnSync: function(collection) {
    console.log('Collection was synchronised with the server');
  }
});
```

#### Function callback

You can also bind a function callback directly in the `modelEvents` attribute:

```javascript
var MyView = Marionette.View.extend({
  collectionEvents: {
    'update': function() {
      console.log('the collection was updated');
    }
  }
})
```

#### Attaching a function

As with most things in Backbone and Marionette, you can attach a function that
returns the object to to attach to `modelEvents`. This is particularly handy for
binding to events based on options passed into the view:

```javascript
var MyView = Marionette.View.extend({
  collectionEvents: function() {
    var events = {};
    var eventToListenTo = this.getOption('customListener');
    events[eventToListenTo] = 'customHandler';
    return events;
  },

  customHandler: function() {
    console.log('I will be called based on the value passed into customListener');
  }
})
```

### Listening to both

If your view has a `model` and `collection` attached, it will listen for events
on both:

```javascript
var MyView = Marionette.View.extend({
  modelEvents: {
    'change:someattribute': 'changeMyAttribute'
  },

  collectionEvents: {
    update: 'modelsChanged'
  },

  changeMyAttribute: function() {
    console.log('someattribute was changed');
  },

  modelsChanged: function() {
    console.log('models were added or removed in the collection');
  }
})
```

In this case, Marionette will bind event handlers to both.

## Advanced View Topics

This method is used to convert a View's `model` or `collection`
into a usable form for a template.

Item Views are called such because they process only a single item
at a time. Consequently, only the `model` **or** the `collection` will
be serialized. If both exist, only the `model` will be serialized.

By default, models are serialized by cloning the attributes of the model.

Collections are serialized into an object of this form:

```js
{
  items: [modelOne, modelTwo]
}
```

where each model in the collection will have its attributes cloned.

The result of `serializeData` is included in the data passed to
the view's template.

Let's take a look at some examples of how serializing data works.

```js
let myModel = new MyModel({foo: "bar"});

new MyView({
  template: "#myItemTemplate",
  model: myModel
});

MyView.render();
```

```html
<script id="myItemTemplate" type="template">
  Foo is: <%= foo %>
</script>
```

If the serialization is a collection, the results are passed in as an
`items` array:

```js
let myCollection = new MyCollection([{foo: "bar"}, {foo: "baz"}]);

new MyView({
  template: "#myCollectionTemplate",
  collection: myCollection
});

MyView.render();
```

```html
<script id="myCollectionTemplate" type="template">
  <% _.each(items, function(item){ %>
    Foo is: <%= foo %>
  <% }); %>
</script>
```

If you need to serialize the View's `model` or `collection` in a custom way,
then you should override either `serializeModel` or `serializeCollection`.

On the other hand, you should not use this method to add arbitrary extra data
to your template. Instead, use [View.templateContext](./marionette.abstractview.md#viewtemplatecontext).
