# Backbone.Marionette

Make your Backbone.js apps dance with a composite application architecture!

## About Marionette

Backbone.Marionette is a composite application library for Backbone.js that
aims to simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript applications. It is
a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in 
the applications that I (Derick Bailey) have been building with Backbone, and
includes various pieces inspired by composite application architectures, 
such as Microsoft's "Prism" framework. 

Backbone.Marionette is designed to be a lightweight and flexible library of 
tools that you can use when you want to. Like Backbone.js itself, you're not 
required to use all of Backbone.Marionette just because you want to use some 
of it.

## Donations

Marionette needs your support, but not everyone can offer assitance 
with code, bug submissions, and answering questions. If you're using 
Marionette and you're finding that it is saving you as much time and 
effort as I believe it does, then please consider financial support 
for the project.

## Documentation

The primary documentation is split up in to multiple files, due to the size
of the over-all documentation. You can find these files in the 
[/docs](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/tree/master/docs) folder, or use the links below to get straight to the
documentation for each peice of Marionette.

### Marionette's Pieces

These are the strings that you can pull to make your puppet dance:

* [**Backbone.Marionette.Application**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.application.md): An application object that starts your app via initializers, and more
* [**Backbone.Marionette.Application.module**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.application.module.md): Create modules and sub-modules within the application
* [**Backbone.Marionette.AppRouter**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.approuter.md): Reduce your routers to nothing more than configuration
* [**Backbone.Marionette.View**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.view.md): The base View type that other Marionette views extend from (not intended to be used directly)
* [**Backbone.Marionette.ItemView**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.itemview.md): A view that renders a single item
* [**Backbone.Marionette.CollectionView**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.collectionview.md): A view that iterates over a collection, and renders individual `ItemView` instances for each model

* [**Backbone.Marionette.Region**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.region.md): Manage visual regions of your application, including display and removal of content
* [**Backbone.Marionette.Layout**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.layout.md): A view that renders a layout and creates region managers to manage areas within it
* [**Backbone.Marionette.EventAggregator**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.eventaggregator.md): An extension of Backbone.Events, to be used as an event-driven or pub-sub tool
* [**Backbone.Marionette.BindTo**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.bindto.md): An event binding manager, to facilitate binding and unbinding of events
* [**Backbone.Marionette.Renderer**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.renderer.md): Render templates with or without data, in a consistent and common manner
* [**Backbone.Marionette.TemplateCache**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.templatecache.md): Cache templates that are stored in `<script>` blocks, for faster subsequent access
* [**Backbone.Marionette.Callbacks**](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.callbacks.md): Manage a collection of callback methods, and execute them as needed

Please note that this is document is rather dry - it's meant to be a reference for
those that just need a reference. If you're looking for an introduction and/or 
examples on how to get started, please see [the Wiki](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/wiki).

### Async / Deferred Rendering Support

Support for asynchronously rendering views, loading templates, etc has been
removed from Marionette directly due to performance problems and overhead
incurred. To get async support in Marionette, then, you need to download and
include the the `backbone.marionette.async.js` or `async.min` file in 
your project. See the above download links and the the 
[async.md](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.async.md)
documentation for more information.

### The Wiki: Sample Apps, Tutorials, And Much More

A wiki is an important aspect of a thriving community, as it provides
a place for the community to contribute ideas, examples, answer
frequently asked questions, and more. If you're looking for
community-driven information, examples that go beyond the
dry technical documentation, or want to contribute your own
ideas and examples to the community, please see the wiki page.

##### [View The Marionette Wiki](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/wiki)

### Annotated Source Code

In addition to this readme, I've commented the source code quite
heavily and run it through Docco as part of my build process.
This produces a nicely formatted, annotated source code as documenation
file.

You can read the annotated for all the detail of how Marionette works, and advice on which methods to override when.

## Help Is Just A Click Away

### [Google Group Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/backbone-marionette)

Get announcements for new releases, share your projects and ideas that are
using Marionette, and join in open-ended discussion that does not fit in
to the Github issues list or StackOverflow Q&A.

**For help with syntax, specific questions on how to implement a feature
using Marionette, and other Q&A items, use StackOverflow.**

### [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backbone.marionette)

Ask questions about using Marionette in specific scenarios, with
specific features. For example, help with syntax, understanding how a feature works and
how to override that feature to do what you need or how to organize the
different view types to work best with your applications needs.

Questions on StackOverflow often turn in to blog posts and wiki entries.

### [Github Issues](//github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/issues)

Report issues with Marionette, submit pull requests to fix problems, or to
create summarized and documented feature requests (preferably with pull
requests that implement the feature).

**Please don't ask questions or seek help in the issues list.** There are
other, better channels for seeking assistance, like StackOverflow and the
Google Groups mailing list.

### [DerickBailey.LosTechies.com](http://derickbailey.lostechies.com)

Lastly, I blog about Marionette on a regular basis, at my
LosTechies.com blog.

## Compatibility And Requirements

Theses libraries are required for the use, development, testing and
documentation of Backbone.Marionette.

### Runtime Requirements

Backbone.Marionette currently works with the following versions of these 
libraries:

* Backbone v0.9.2
* Underscore v1.3.3
* jQuery v1.7.2

While support for Zepto and Enderjs has been added, it is not officially
tested against these libraries at this time.

Marionette has not been tested against any other versions of these
libraries. You may or may not have success if you use a version other
than what it listed here.

## Build Tools Used

I use a number of tools to build, test and maintain Marionette, including
but not limited to:

### Anvil.js

The [Anvil.js](https://github.com/arobson/anvil.js) project is used
to generate the builds for Backbone.Marionette. You can run the
`build.sh` file from a terminal, or the `build.cmd` file for Windows 
users, after installing anvil.

### Test Suite

Backbone.Marionette is also tested with the Jasmine JavaScript test utility,
using the Jasmine Ruby gem. 

To get the test suite up and running, you need a Ruby installation with the 
latest RubyGems. Install the 'bundler' gem and then run 'bundle install' from 
the project's root folder. Then run `rake jasmine` to run the test suite, and
load up http://localhost:8888 to see the test suite in action.

### Annotated Source Code

I'm using [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) to generate the annotated source code.

## Release Notes

For change logs and release notes, see the
[changelog](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.marionette/blob/master/changelog.md) file.
