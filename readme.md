## About Marionette

Backbone.Marionette is a composite application library for Backbone.js that
aims to simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript applications.
It is a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in
applications.

## Documentation

All of the documentation for Marionette can be found at

##### [marionettejs.com/docs/current](http://marionettejs.com/docs/current)

### App Architecture On Backbone's Building Blocks

Backbone provides a great set of building blocks for our JavaScript
applications. It gives us the core constructs that are needed to build
small apps, organize jQuery DOM events, or create single page apps that
support mobile devices and large scale enterprise needs. But Backbone is
not a complete framework. It's a set of building blocks. It leaves
much of the application design, architecture and scalability to the
developer, including memory management, view management, and more.

Marionette brings an application architecture to Backbone, along with
built in view management and memory management. It's designed to be a
lightweight and flexible library of tools that sits on top of Backbone,
providing the framework for building a scalable application.

Like Backbone itself, you're not required to use all of Marionette just
because you want to use some of it. You can pick and choose which features
you want to use. This allows you to work with other Backbone
frameworks and plugins easily. It also means that you are not required
to engage in an all-or-nothing migration to begin using Marionette.

### Chat with us

Find us [on gitter](https://gitter.im/marionettejs/backbone.marionette) or on IRC in the FreeNode.net [#marionette channel](http://freenode.net).

We're happy to discuss design patterns and learn how you're using Marionette.


### Key Benefits

* Scalable: applications are built in modules, and with event-driven architecture
* Sensible defaults: Underscore templates are used for view rendering
* Easily modifiable: make it work with your application's specific needs
* Reduce boilerplate for views, with specialized view types
* Build on a modular architecture with an `Application` and modules that attach to it
* Compose your application's visuals at runtime, with the `Region` and `LayoutView` objects
* Nested views and layouts within visual regions
* Built-in memory management and zombie-killing in views, regions and layoutViews
* Event-driven architecture with `Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator`
* Flexible, "as-needed" architecture allowing you to pick and choose what you need
* And much, much more
